As applications move from the desktop to the web browser security needs to be taken into consideration. The new Web Cryptography API provides native support for web applications to perform cryptographic operations and key management functions. Client side cryptographic support is a critical component in the future development of secure web based applications.


This thesis presents an exploration of the Web Cryptography API to evaluate its capabilities and interfaces. This exploration was performed by building an end to end encrypted messaging system that implements the off the record (OTR) messaging protocol. This thesis also proposes JWCL, a wrapper library around the native Web Cryptography API that provides network portable output, secure default options, and a class based modern interface. 


In this thesis the Web Cryptography API is shown to be capable of supporting the development of a functional, proof of concept, end to end encrypted messaging system in the web browser. JWCL succeeds in providing a higher level, straightforward, and sensible interface to the low level Web Cryptography API.
