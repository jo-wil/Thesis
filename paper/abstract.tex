As applications move from the desktop to the web browser security needs to be taken into consideration. The new Web Cryptography API provides native support for web applications to perform cryptographic operations and key management functions. 


This thesis presents an exploration of the Web Cryptography API to evaluate its capabilities and interfaces. This exploration was completed by building an end to end encrypted messaging system that implements the off the record (OTR) messaging protocol. This thesis also proposes JWCL, a wrapper library around the native Web Cryptography API that provides network portable output, secure default options, and a class based modern interface. 


The Web Cryptography API was capable of supporting the development of a functional, proof of concept, end to end encrypted messaging system in the web browser.
